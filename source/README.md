# folder 'source' of Speech2Shorts

The folder must have these 2 files.

- google_client_secret.json
    
    This file is automatically made by Google Cloud.

    you should make an oauth, and download this secret api key file.

  ```
    the file contains this shape:
    
    {   
      "installed": {
        "client_id":"xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
        "project_id":"----------",
        "auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",

        "client_secret":"xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx",
        "redirect_uris":["http://localhost"]
      }
    }
  ```

- openai_client_secret.txt

  This file contains the secret key of your OpenAI API.

  You should just manually make a file with this name, with this line.

  ```

The folder also can have this one more file.
